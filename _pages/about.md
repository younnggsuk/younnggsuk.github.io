# üëãüèª About Me

I‚Äôm Youngsuk Lee, an Applied AI Researcher.  
Currently, I‚Äôm focusing on enabling vision models to adapt to or generalize unseen data more quickly.  
Some topics I'm interested in are Domain Adaptation/Generalization, Meta Learning, Self-supervised Learning, and Active Learning.

  - **Developed vision inspection system for semiconductor images:**  
    *(Self-supervised Learning, Active Learning, Image Classification)*
    - Developed an automatic visual inspection system for defect discrimination in a scenario with continually changing data and defect criteria.
    - Applied self-supervised learning to enhance generalizability and active learning for rapid adaptation to new data.
  - **Developed semi-automatic labeling system for medical images:**  
    *(Medical Image Segmentation, Interactive Segmentation)*
    - Applied interactive segmentation algorithms to label 3D lesions with minimal user interactions.
    - Utilized geodesic distance transform to effectively convey user interactions to the model, improving performance.

    *(GAN, Image-to-Image Translation)*
    - Conducted research projects aimed at predicting patient responses to treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in collaboration with Kim's Eye Hospital.
    - Applied GAN-based Image-to-Image Translation methods with an attention mechanism to generate post-treatment images focusing on lesion areas.
  - **Performed educational facilitation in AI education programs:**  
    *(Learning Facilitation, Education)*
    - Acted as a facilitator to help students understand AI, DL/ML basics and Python programming.
    - Conducted a lecture on implementing computer vision research papers to enhance students' proficiency indeep learning frameworks.
